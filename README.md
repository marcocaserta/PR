We carry out three types of analysis, all at company level, i.e., for each company:

* Best matching: We generate a set of queries to find the best match in a language set given a PR in the other language. More precisely, each PR in English is treated as a query and the search for the closest PR in the Spanish set. Then, the opposite is done, taking each PR in Spanish as a query, and searching for the closest match in English. The raw associations are found in the files called `comparison_{company}_{direction}.xlsx`, where the direction indicates which of the two languages is used as query. The first table below reports the average across all the PR of a given company.
* Topic modeling and comparison: We extract the top $n$ topics in the English and Spanish sets (in my exercise below,  $n=10$). We then compute the distance between the topics in the two languages. More precisely, we first find the best match between each pair of topics and then we compute the average distance across the pairs of best matches.
* Topics for the PR with low similarity score. We select the Spanish PR whose similarity score with the closest English PR is in the bottom 20th percentile. For these low similarity PRs, we extract the main topics. That is, we want to identify which topics are discussed in Spanish but not in English.
